## üîç Project Overview

As a **Beginner Data Analyst**, this project served as a hands-on learning experience to extract valuable intelligence from Amazon product and customer review data. My primary goal was to illuminate key trends and patterns that could empower e-commerce stakeholders to make more informed decisions, ultimately fostering **data-driven improvements** in product offerings and customer satisfaction.

## üìä Dataset Insights

My analysis was conducted on a publicly available dataset meticulously scraped from Amazon product pages. This comprehensive collection encompasses **1,465 unique product records**, detailed across **16 distinct columns**.

**Highlights of the Data Fields:**
- `Product Name` and `Category`
- `Actual Price` & `Discounted Price`
- `Discount %` (a crucial calculated metric)
- `Rating` (average product satisfaction score)
- `Rating Count` (total volume of customer feedback)
- Aggregated `Review Content`
- Derived metrics like `Potential Revenue` to gauge market opportunity.

## üìã Core Analytical Questions & Approaches

To derive meaningful insights, I tackled a series of business-centric questions, employing various Excel functionalities:

| # | Analytical Question                                                 | Excel Approach & Logic Used                                      |
|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | What is the average discount percentage by product category?        | Pivot Table with AVERAGE function                                |
| 2 | How many products are listed under each category?                   | Pivot Table using COUNT of unique products                       |
| 3 | What is the total number of reviews per category?                   | Pivot Table with SUM of `Rating Count`                           |
| 4 | Which products boast the highest average ratings?                   | Data Sorting + Pivot Table displaying Average `Rating`           |
| 5 | What is the average actual price vs. discounted price by category?  | Pivot Table comparing Averages of `Actual Price` and `Discounted Price` |
| 6 | Which products have accumulated the highest number of reviews?      | Data Sorting + Pivot Table with SUM of `Rating Count`            |
| 7 | How many products feature a discount of 50% or more?                | Filtering Logic and COUNTROWS function                           |
| 8 | What is the distribution pattern of product ratings (e.g., 3.0, 4.0)? | Pivot Table with Product Counts grouped by `Rating`              |
| 9 | What is the total potential revenue (`actual_price` √ó `rating_count`) per category? | Creation of a Calculated Column + Pivot Table with SUM of `Potential Revenue` |
| 10| What is the unique product count per defined price range bucket (<‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500, >‚Çπ500)? | `IF` formulas for custom bucketing + Pivot Table (COUNT unique) |
| 11| How does product rating relate to the level of discount offered?    | Grouping Discounts + Pivot Table showing Average `Rating`        |
| 12| How many products currently have fewer than 1,000 reviews?          | Filtering Logic and COUNTROWS function                           |
| 13| Which categories feature products with the highest average discounts? | Sorted Pivot Table by AVERAGE `Discount %` per category          |
| 14| Identifying the top 5 products based on combined review count and rating. | Custom Ranking Logic (e.g., a weighted score combining both metrics) |

## üìà Key Business Discoveries & Impact

My analysis yielded several significant insights, offering valuable perspectives for e-commerce strategies:

* **Optimizing Revenue Streams:** Discovered that categories like **Home & Kitchen** and **Electronics** hold the highest `Potential Revenue`. This insight is crucial for prioritizing marketing spend and inventory focus on products with strong market demand and customer engagement.
* **Smarter Pricing Strategies:** Revealed that a **high discount doesn't automatically translate to higher product ratings or customer satisfaction**. This finding empowers sellers to move beyond aggressive discounting and explore more sustainable pricing models while maintaining positive customer perception.
* **Boosting Customer Engagement:** Identified **Electronics and Accessories** as leading categories in customer reviews. This suggests prime opportunities for implementing targeted feedback campaigns, community building, or loyalty programs to deepen customer relationships.
* **Strategic Product Development:** Highlighted products with solid review volumes but moderate ratings. These represent excellent opportunities for **focused quality improvements** or targeted feedback collection, allowing for a strategic uplift in customer satisfaction.
* **Informed Market Positioning:** Gained clarity on product distribution across various price points. This understanding is vital for **competitive analysis** and making data-backed decisions on pricing, new product introductions, and market segmentation.
